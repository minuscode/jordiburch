**Barcelona, Spain, 1979. Jordi is now living in Sao Paulo, Brazil**

With a special interest on building human touching stories, he’s always with his head full of ideas and, as he likes to call his future work, “novels”.

He regularly publishes in many Portuguese magazines and also in international ones such as National Geographic, Courrier International, Russian Playboy and Folha de São Paulo. In 2007 he joined the Portuguese collective Kameraphoto.

Jordi features include as an example, social documentary on living conditions in a Lisbon’s slum or a moroccan family daily life growing hashish.
